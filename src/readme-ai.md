##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | The project employs a modular architecture, combining React for UI, TypeScript for type safety, and a RESTful API to manage backend interactions. It integrates WebSockets for real-time updates, ensuring a responsive and scalable front-end platform. |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | The codebase adheres to strong TypeScript and JavaScript best practices, with consistent styling facilitated through Material-UI and custom hooks. It employs modular and reusable components, enhancing maintainability. The code is well-structured, making it easy to follow and extend. |
| 📄 | **Documentation** | The documentation is moderately thorough, with type definitions provided through `.d.ts` files, and some inline comments. However, certain complex components and utilities might benefit from expanded documentation to aid understanding and ease of use. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**  | The project integrates key external libraries, including Material-UI for styling, React DnD for drag-and-drop functionality, and Jest for testing. It also relies on WebSockets for real-time data synchronization and interactions with a RESTful backend API. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | The codebase exhibits high modularity, with components, utilities, and contexts split into well-defined, reusable units. The modular structure facilitates easier maintenance and scalability, allowing individual components to be adapted or replaced as needed. |
| 🧪 | **Testing**       | The project uses Jest with custom matchers from `@testing-library/jest-dom` for unit testing. The tests cover critical components and utilities, ensuring interactions with the DOM are thoroughly validated. There’s room for enhanced testing of complex business logic and API interactions. |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | The application is optimized for performance with efficient state management and debounced input handling. While animations and real-time updates enhance the user experience, the project must manage resource usage carefully, particularly in WebSocket-heavy scenarios. |
| 🛡️ | **Security**      | The project implements role-based access control (RBAC) for secure routing and user management. Sensitive operations are restricted to authenticated users, with further security provided through token-based authentication and HTTPS APIs. |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**  | Key dependencies include React, TypeScript, Material-UI, Vite for builds, and Jest for testing. The project relies on `@testing-library/react` for testing React components and `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop interactions. WebSocket integration is also a core dependency. |
| 🚀 | **Scalability**   | The architecture supports scalability through modular components, efficient state management, and real-time updates with WebSockets. However, scalability will depend on the backend's ability to handle increased traffic and the front-end's ability to process large data sets. |
